# semantic-seo-refactor

## Description

I added semantic elements to provide a clear layout of the webpage. In order to follow a logical structure, I wanted to ensure all image sources were listed within the index file. I ensured all image sources contained a description for accessibility. I checked that all headings fell in order. I updated the title to highlight the company name. I applied the Scout Rule.
